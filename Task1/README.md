This assignment was part of the selection process for the Deep Thought internship. I was provided with a Figma file by the DT team, which contained the design to replicate. The task involved accurately converting the design into a functional web page, ensuring that all elements and layout matched the given specifications. Through this project, I showcased my ability to follow detailed design guidelines and demonstrated proficiency in translating Figma designs into code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
